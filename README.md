# Sidecar and TxWrapper Integration

This is a guide to using
[Substrate API Sidecar](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate-api-sidecar) and
[TxWrapper](https://github.com/paritytech/txwrapper) to construct, sign, and submit a transaction to
a Substrate-based chain.

> Note: This will work on any Substrate-based chain, but for now is only set up to work on Polkadot
> or a development chain using Polkadot's SS58 address encoding.

## Instructions

Tested on:

- Polkadot v0.8.0
- Sidecar v0.6.0
- Txwrapper v3.1.1

### Start a Node

If you have access to a sidecar endpoint, then you can skip this step.

Start a Polkadot node. Can be local development node (`--dev`) or connect to mainnet. See the
[Polkadot repo](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot) for instructions.

### Set up Sidecar

Clone the sidecar repo and start with `yarn; yarn start;`. It will connect to `localhost` by default
and start an http server on port 8080.

### Run

The main function will:

1. Connect to the sidecar and collect all the necessary information to construct a transaction.
1. Create a signing payload for a balance transfer.
1. Wait for you to sign the payload.
1. Submit the transaction.

#### Construction

In `index.ts` you will need to enter the transaction parameters:

```ts
const inputs: UserInputs = {
  senderAddress: '15oF4uVJwmo4TdGW7VfQxNLavjCXviqxT9S1MgbjMNHr6Sp5', //Alice
  recipientAddress: '14E5nqKAp3oAJcmzgZhUD2RcptBeUBScxKHgJKU4HPNcKVf3', //Bob
  transferValue: 1 * DECIMALS, // DOTs
  tip: 0 * DECIMALS, // DOTs
  eraPeriod: 64, // Blocks
  chainName: 'Polkadot', // 'Polkadot', 'Kusama', or 'Westend'
  specName: 'polkadot', // 'polkadot', 'kusama', or 'westend'
  sidecarHost: 'http://127.0.0.1:8080/', // Sidecar
};
```

Run `yarn start` and you will get:

```bash
Network Version: 1008

Transaction Details:
  Sending Account:   15oF4uVJwmo4TdGW7VfQxNLavjCXviqxT9S1MgbjMNHr6Sp5
  Receiving Account: 14E5nqKAp3oAJcmzgZhUD2RcptBeUBScxKHgJKU4HPNcKVf3
  Amount: 1000000000000
  Tip:    0

Signing Payload: 0xa005038eaf04151687736326c9fea17e25fc5287613693c912909cb226aa4794f26a48070010a5d4e895030000f00300003a5dacb3a8725d578ab4b1457764e960a86b17720c3d39086c3b0872122b7a41f837b149dcb20f92540a027e58aab0554d2d42f36887f33a5e6a85ebdd0f13d8

Signature:
```

This will wait for you to sign the payload.

#### Signing

You can sign the payload in any way you like. Ideally, you should do this on a secure, offline
device. A signing script is provided to use for testing.

In `sign.ts`, enter the sending account and network version from the last step:

```ts
// Address that corresponds to the signing key
const senderAddress = '15oF4uVJwmo4TdGW7VfQxNLavjCXviqxT9S1MgbjMNHr6Sp5';
const registryInputs: RegistryInfo = {
  chainName: 'Polkadot',
  specName: 'polkadot',
  specVersion: 1008, // Network Version from previous step
};
```

Create a new file called `key.ts` that exports a signing key and type. An example for 'Alice' is
provided. In here you can put your signing key. It can be a 12 word phrase or secret seed. Or, in
the case of a dev chain, just `//Alice`:

```ts
// Type of signing curve. Do not change.
type Curve = 'sr25519' | 'ed25519' | 'ecdsa';
// Key type. Must be one of `Curve`.
export const curve = 'sr25519';
// The actual signing key. Can include `//hard-derivation`, `/soft-derivation`, or `///password`.
export const signingKey = '//Alice';
```

Run `yarn sign` and enter the signing payload from the last step to get a signature:

```bash
$ yarn sign

Payload: <enter the signing payload here>

Signature: 0x014679aaf0589f456f57875837c3c3f9747dee901304e05fe9511eece5bfd68c1e7443ff6d476f170d80cbbabae5f6bd3cf3d486663fe8f68d48e8ea7c70edc18d
```

#### Submission

Paste this signature into the terminal that is waiting, press enter, and it will submit the
transaction to your node.
